<p>
	Being a 3rd generation mango cultivator the beginnings of Anish Farms go back to 1950s. Most of our orchards date from the 50s. After taking over the companyâ€™s reins from his father in the 90s, the current proprietor, Umesh Lanjekar decided to radically change from conventional methods of cultivation. With the onset of organic food revolution, Anish Farms was on the first and very few mango farm to convert to organic label. The company's aims have since then been to deliver our clients with the best culinary experience while continuing to remain committed to ecological and sustainable farming practices.
